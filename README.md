This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

In this project, I worked on a project called **Capstone Courses** using react. There were no milestones but requirements. Instead of building a real-estate website I've created an online courses website.

The full project requirements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Listings-App-f3610268057941e481d35b269da30f0c).

## Backend

For the backend I've used rails. For now you can see courses, make a filter search among courses.You can sign-up, log-in and log-out. You can see rails-api app [here](https://github.com/YemreAybey/online-courses-api)

## Built With

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js
- npm
- Create-React-App
