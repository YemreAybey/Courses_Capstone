## Info

This project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ 'The Global School for Remote Software Developers!').

In this project, I worked on a project called **Capstone Courses** using react, redux and rails. There were no milestones but requirements. I've created an online course management website that allows users to add specific courses to their favourites or remove them and search for the courses that are related to a specific software language. The web-site is only for mobile size devices for now.

The full project requirements can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/Final-Capstone-Project-Listings-App-f3610268057941e481d35b269da30f0c).

## Backend

For the backend I've used rails. For now you can see courses, make a filter search among courses.You can sign-up, log-in, log-out, add courses to your favourites and see your favourites. You can see rails-api app [here](https://github.com/YemreAybey/online-courses-api)
